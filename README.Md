## Number Classification API üöÄ
This is a Node.js API built with TypeScript and Express for classifying numbers based on various mathematical properties.

## Features of this API
1. Determines if a number is prime, perfect, Armstrong, even, or odd
2. It calculates the sum of the digits of the number
3. It fetches a fun fact about the number from the Numbers API
4. Typescript is used for type safety
5. It supports API versioning (/api/v1)
6. Implements error handling and validation

## Mathematical Concepts Behind the Classifications
# Prime Number
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. This means it cannot be divided evenly by any other number.

 - **Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...**
 - **The function checks divisibility by iterating from 2 to sqrt(n), as factors appear in pairs.**

## Perfect Number
A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
 - **Examples: 6, 28, 496, 8128**
 - **For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3 ‚Üí 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so it's a perfect number.**

## Armstrong Number (Narcissistic Number)
An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

 - **Examples: 153, 370, 371, 407**

 - **For instance, 371: [ 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371 ]**
 Since the sum equals the original number, 371 is an Armstrong number.

## How to use API

### **Base URL:**  
```
local: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/classify-number
```
```
production: https://olympic-guenna-blard-02d32c23.koyeb.app/api/v1/classify-number
```

### **Endpoints**
#### ‚û§ Classify a Number
**GET** `/api/v1/classify-number/:number`

##### **Example Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/classify-number/30
```
##### **Example Response:**
```json
{
   "number": 30,
   "is_prime": false,
   "is_perfect": false,
   "properties": [
   "even"
],
   "digit_sum": 3,
   "fun_fact": "30 is the consumption in pounds of candy annually per person in Denmark, the country with the highest candy consumption."
}
```

#### ‚û§ Error Handling
If an invalid number is provided, the API returns a **400 Bad Request**:
```json
{
   "number": "alphabet",
   "error": true,
}
```
